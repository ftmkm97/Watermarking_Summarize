35232142,"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.
Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
""It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,"" she said.
""That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
""Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?""
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
""I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,"" he said.
""Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.""
He said it was important that ""immediate steps"" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
""The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,"" said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: ""The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.""
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.

34540833,"Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau.
Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.
Glasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.
Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.
Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.
It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.
Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.
But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.
The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.
It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.
Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.
The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.
However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.
Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: ""We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.
""Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.
""It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.""

Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later.
The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident.
The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety.
Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium.
""As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,"" he told BBC Wales Sport.
""If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.""

He told BBC Sport: ""It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.

He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.
Gundogan said: ""Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.

And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.
He said: ""Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.

35890902,"Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.
Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.
Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.
The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a ""dongle"" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.
""That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,"" Mr Newlin said.
By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.
The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).
The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).
Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.
The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.
Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.
Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.
Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,
But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.","Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a ""dongle"" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\""They are not encrypted at all, so they are vulnerable to spoofing,"" said Mr Newlin, one of",0.257,"Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.ٍٍ݀݁݁݁ ݁ ك݁цٍ̍̃̃݀ใส้ แรรแ้เแ เด้สิใแ้Âแхส ใх้ бю้жใ, said Bastille, which carried out the research.݁   ц�",14.2,0.031152391,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.15862068965517243, recall=0.9583333333333334, fmeasure=0.27218934911242604), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.13194444444444445, recall=0.8260869565217391, fmeasure=0.2275449101796407), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.15862068965517243, recall=0.9583333333333334, fmeasure=0.27218934911242604)}"

30844962,"The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday.
The EC said that its ""preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.""
However, Amazon said it ""has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg"".
""We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],"" it said.
The Luxembourg finance ministry said: ""Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,"" it said.
The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.
The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.
The Commission said it had ""no indication"" that the tax arrangement was ""compatible with the internal market"".
The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck.
Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg.
Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's ""transfer pricing"" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.
Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.
The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether ""Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty"" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.
""If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,"" the EC said.
It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.
Luxembourg's finance ministry said it ""has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.""
""Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,"" it added.
Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected ""sweetheart"" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.

The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years.

It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013.
The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year.
The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions.
One of this year's highlights is an ""edible garden"", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates.
The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home.
The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show.
Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers.
For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead.

He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information.
Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".
Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy.
Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine ""sting"" operation.
Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.
In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.
Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private.
On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: ""Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts.""
Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines.
In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was ""not burdensome"" to do so.
However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.
On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded.

37903647,"A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair.
He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls.
Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted.
His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote.
The State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, ""further degraded the legitimacy of the election"".
""We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,"" he added.
Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger.
A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors.
Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory.
But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a ""farce"".
The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting.
They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%.
Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president.
Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out.
Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment.
A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built.

The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza.
Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder.
""To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,"" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death.
She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend.
Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships.
They say ""corrective rape"" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or ""correct"" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common.
Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement.
She said it was important to get ""corrective rape"" classified as a hate crime.
""The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,"" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action.
""In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,"" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying.
Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community.
""The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,"" he said.
In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg.

34944735,"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.
The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.
This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.
This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.
Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.
""We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,"" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.
They then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.
""If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,"" Mr Hsiung explained.
Given that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated ""the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this"".
The answer? ""Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.""
What is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.
The team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.
They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a ""structural colour"" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.
The results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.
""That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,"" Mr Hsiung said.
""If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.""
So why did all these different species acquire the same colour?
Given their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.
That is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.
""It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,"" Mr Hsiung said. ""That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.
""But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.""
It may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.
""We don't know yet,"" Mr Hsiung said.

32159602,"Internet searches from the week before the crash were found on the tablet computer used by Andreas Lubitz,
Meanwhile, the second ""black box"" flight recorder from the plane has been recovered.
There were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March.
The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included ""ways to commit suicide"" and ""cockpit doors and their security provisions"".
Spokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: ""He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide.
""In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.''
Prosecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March.
Lubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.
The first ""black box"", the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site.
Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit.
The second ""black box"" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.
At a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was ""reasonable hope"" the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information.
The ""completely blackened"" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said.
He said: ""The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight.""
He told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.
As each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said,
He added 40 mobile phones had been recovered. He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were ""heavily damaged"".
Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.
Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of ""severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.
``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.
She could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.

He said there was often ""horseplay"" with colleagues, involving ""piggybacks, tickling and squeezing"".
But he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.
Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.
He joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.
Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with ""hundreds"" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.
Under questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.
""It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.""
He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a ""full performance"" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.
Mr Caplan asked: ""Could those comments become edgy or sexual?""
Mr Fox replied: ""Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.""
Referring to the ""horseplay"" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, ""otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio"".
Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: ""I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?
""Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.""
He added: ""But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.""

The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.
Addressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a ""play-acting high jinks thing"", he said.
Mr Fox told the court he had seen it ""many times"", but agreed that out of context, the ""Benny Hill-style"" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.
Prosecutor John Price QC said: ""She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?""
Mr Fox replied: ""I can't get in (her) head.""
Mr Price continued: ""Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?"" to which the defendant replied: ""No.""
Mr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.
""It never happened,"" he said, although he did acknowledge he ""could have easily taken her for a tour"".
Mr Fox agreed it would be ""quite wrong"" for an adult man to ""stick his tongue"" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.
If a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with ""a social kiss"" on the cheek, he said.
The girl in question had, he added, ""become a little bit obsessed with me"".
Asked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: ""I don't have an explanation at all.""
Mr Price said: ""Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?""
The DJ replied: ""I can't explain those coincidences.""

33578778,"Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will ""go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever"".
The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.
The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures.
In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: ""This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.""
Asked how long that would take, he replied: ""It has failed already.""
Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently.
He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign.
""We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.""
Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week.
But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements.
As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme.
Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout.
Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks.
But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks.
On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures.
But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420.
Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states.
It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.","Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will ""go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever"".The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.

36888270,"The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme.
A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban.
""I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,"" said Craven.
On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part.
But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit.
""I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,"" he added.
""We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale.

The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 ""disappearing positive samples"" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report.
Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis.

Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help ""generate immediate benefits"" for the economy.
But Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inadequate"" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers.
Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties.
With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans.
The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions.
The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England.
A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships.
Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes.
The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales.
Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation.
Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth.
She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government.
She said: ""This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims.""
Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to ""top up"" existing policies.
He said: ""There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.""
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.
""The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales,"" she said.

And he said the costs of leaving would be ""substantial"" and ""unpalatable"".
Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of the UK's departure from the EU.
Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was a ""peculiar speech in the sense that it looked backwards the whole time"".
He told BBC Newsnight: ""It was almost like a re-fight of the referendum... strangely bitter really, and almost really the speech of someone who simply refuses to accept that the British people should have made a decision such as they did.""
Prime Minister Theresa May plans to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins two years of formal negotiations, by the end of March.
She has already confirmed the UK will not remain a member of the EU single market but will instead seek a new free trade deal with the remaining members.
In a speech in London, Sir John, who campaigned for a Remain vote in June's referendum, claimed there was ""little chance"" the advantages of being part of the EU single market could be replicated once the UK leaves.
""I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic,"" he said.
""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery.""
For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.
In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not.
First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"".
It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally, the US, as a consequence.
Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe.
What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concern about how the public is being treated in the months after the referendum decision.

Sir John said Brexit talks require ""statesmanship of a high order"" and warned of a ""real risk"" of the exit deal falling ""well below the hopes and expectations"" that have been raised, saying he doubted the ""rosy confidence being offered to the British people"".
""In my own experience, the most successful results are obtained when talks are conducted with goodwill: it is much easier to reach agreement with a friend than a quarrelsome neighbour.
""Behind the diplomatic civilities, the atmosphere is already sour. A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.""
He also said the ""cheerleaders"" for Brexit had shown a ""disregard that amounts to contempt"" towards those that backed the losing side.
And he said the UK would become ""far more dependent"" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as ""less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors"".
Sir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that ""uncertainties over border restrictions"" after Brexit were ""a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South"".

36832879,"Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday.
The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected.
Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed.
It said the repair work was ""extremely complex"" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it.
Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday.
Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted.
London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate.
Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: ""Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job.
""While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed.
""This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground.""
Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working ""as hard as possible"" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour.
Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole ""couldn't be in a worse place"".
""This is a massive piece of railway,"" he told BBC Radio London. ""It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge.""
Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far.
Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling.
Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption.
And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area.
It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute.
New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

14958201,"Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay.
The introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo.
It was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season

James Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City.
And it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium.

Everton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break.
But David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance.
Moyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in.
Mancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.
Everton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.
Moyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.
Sergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.
It was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.
Balotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.

The visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.
Balotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.
Silva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.
Everton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.

34352262,"Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.
But Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.
Ms Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.
Delayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.
Ms Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.
She said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.
Ms Dugdale added: ""That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.
""That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.""
She also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to ""completely eradicate"" the problem.
The substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.""
A delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.
Dr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.
According to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed ""zero delays over six weeks"" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.
The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.
Dr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.

Ms Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said ""real progress"" was being made.
She later added: ""Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.
""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.""
That comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.
Dr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.
He also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.
Dr Simpson added: ""We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.
""Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.
""Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.""
But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.
""Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.
""Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.""","Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.But Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past.

The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date.
The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system.
Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea.

It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills.
RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water.
The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020.
However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted ""too late"" and was failing in its obligations.
Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020.""
Welsh Water added: ""We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.""

The Pope is due to celebrate Mass on Sunday in Havana's iconic Revolution Square.
He will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the US.
Following his arrival on Cuba on Saturday, thousands lined the route of the Pope's motorcade to the home of the Vatican's ambassador to Cuba.
Pope Francis - the first pontiff to hail from Latin America  - is credited with helping the recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US.
Mr Castro has thanked the Pope for his contribution.
Speaking at the airport alongside President Castro, Pope Francis urged further support for Cuba's Catholics ""so that the Church can continue to support and encourage the Cuban people in its hopes and concerns, with the freedom, the means and the space needed to bring the proclamation of the kingdom to the existential peripheries of society"".
He also called on Cuba and the US to ""persevere on the path"" of detente.
On Thursday the Vatican said it hoped the Pope's visit would help bring an end to the 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the island.
Pensioner Diego Carrera told AP the visit was ""like a breath of hope blowing over Cuba"" because of the role that the Pope played in the reestablishment of relations with the US.
On Friday the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Communist Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations.

Disembarking to chants of ""Christ lives"" and other religious slogans, the Pope was welcomed off the plane by Raul Castro. He was quick to praise the pontiff for his leadership on issues of climate change and poverty and thanked him for his role in brokering talks with Washington.
The Pope said he was in Cuba to ""support and encourage the Cuban people in their hopes and concerns"". While he didn't shy away from using the word ""freedom"" in his initial address, he is still unlikely to publically berate the Cuban government over its human rights record - choosing instead a more pragmatic approach.
As the first Latin American pope, he's likely to receive a unique welcome from the Cuban people - many of whom remember when a commitment to atheism was a key part of the constitution.
Cuba all set for Pope Francis
Cristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square.
Workers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir on the square.
Streets have been newly paved in Havana, and the cathedral has been renovated.
In the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.
Nearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists were expected to cover the visit.
In 1998 Pope John Paul II became the first Pope to visit the island, saying: ""May Cuba... open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.""

All the tries came in the second half with Liam Williams and Gareth Davies crossing as Wales twice opened an eight-point lead.
But Juan Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo both scored as the Pumas refused to lie down.
Full-back Leigh Halfpenny's 78th-minute penalty edged Wales four points clear to settle the encounter.
The Toulon full-back scored 14 points with the boot, which ultimately proved the difference between the sides in a match which did not quite live up to expectations.
Read: Wales restored pride, says Howley
Howley praises 'world class' lock Jones
Following their 32-8 defeat by Australia the previous week, Wales were relieved to hang on against a Pumas side that refused to buckle in the face of extreme pressure.
After coach Rob Howley had asked for a response from his team, man of the match Alun Wyn Jones and wing Williams - who both missed the Wallabies defeat - made a huge impact on their returns.
Williams' determination for his try typified a full-blooded display by the Scarlets back.
Argentina failed to rediscover the exciting running which saw them beat Ireland at the same stadium in the 2015 World Cup.
And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern.
Wales controlled the opening period but, apart from two penalties by Halfpenny, had little to show for their dominance at the break as Argentina repeatedly infringed in their own 22.
When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play.

After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez.
When Davies dummied over for his eighth international try and Halfpenny converted, it looked as though Wales would pull clear.
But the Pumas, with Sanchez a probing threat at fly-half, hit back again when Landajo was given the benefit of the doubt by television official Sean Davey.
An exchange of penalties meant Wales led by a point before Halfpenny eased the nerves with his fifth successful kick of the game.

35550407,"Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years.
But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health.
And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions.
Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013.
Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages.
This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012.
The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013.
Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease.
In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important.
Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving ""a good quality of life in later years even more important"".
""This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,"" he said.
""Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years.""
He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas.
Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years.
""Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,"" he said.
In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics.

38636995,"Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year.
Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.
Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase.
Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later.
Mr McAveety said: ""Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city.
""One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city.""
The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure.
But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in.
Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections.
BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: ""Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase.
""Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place.
""They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'.
""However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts.""
Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely.
There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire.
The Scottish government has said more money would be available in the coming financial year for local services across Scotland.
For example, there will be new money through the council tax changes and cash which will be given to headteachers to spend on schemes to raise attainment.

36289151,"Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide.
He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result.
""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.
Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.
It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda.
Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation.
In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.
Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission ""lacked independence and transparency"", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that ""those Europeans are not serious"".
""Transparency is what we've been voting for,"" he added.
Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.
However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.
On Friday, the US said Mr Museveni should ""rein in"" his security forces after they briefly arrested Mr Besigye, and fired tear gas to disperse his supporters in Kampala.","""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.On Friday, the US said Mr Museveni should ""rein in"" his security forces after they briefly arrested him.The US also criticised Uganda's security forces for using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse his supporters in Kampala.In a BBC interview, the Ugandan president said he was ""not surprised"" by the arrest, and accused Mr Besgye of planning to incite violence.素組紡紙級紛純紴紗細紜紨紕紅紀紪紑紫紝紁紬紐�",-1.28,"Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.""[He] has now been charged with treason,"" said a senior police official in Kampala, who added that the charges were not serious and that the case would be heard next week.曹華菮落書更班珮曰珲珯曪現柔珽森染柑柱柳柩柏柃查柠柚柝柙柣柦柟柗柤柨柪柲柂柫柷柭査柜柿柺�",13.8,0.225783416,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.24752475247524752, recall=0.4807692307692308, fmeasure=0.326797385620915), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.04, recall=0.0784313725490196, fmeasure=0.05298013245033112), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.12871287128712872, recall=0.25, fmeasure=0.16993464052287582)}"

Australia would have won had replacement Kurtley Beale not failed with two late penalties.
""It was a remarkable win and a remarkable result,"" North said.
""It was an unbelievable feeling. We won and I got my first [Lions] Test try. It doesn't get much better than that.
""My heart was in my mouth at the end. I think everyone was feeling the same.
""It's always good to get a win, and while it was tough towards the end we are delighted to have got that first win in the series.
""We've spoken a lot about momentum these past few weeks, and that could be huge for us now heading into the second Test next week.""
The Wallabies were leading 7-3 through Israel Folau's converted before the Lions hit back with a fine individual try from North.
The 21-year-old, making his Lions Test debut, effortlessly beat three players during a 60-metre run before crossing for his third try of the tour.
""When the ball dropped out of the sky, my first thought was just to run,"" said North.
""Luckily, I saw a gap and I just went for it. It opened up for me, and I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line.""
North, who has joined Northampton Saints from Scarlets ahead of the 2013-14 season, thought he had struck again just five minutes later when he squeezed over in the corner.
But the television match official ruled a combination of opposite number Israel Folau getting a hand underneath the ball and the Lions wing's free arm hitting the touchline meant no try.
""I felt it was a try. At the end of the day, the TMO makes his call and you have to live with it. But I certainly felt that I had got there,"" North added.
""Perhaps one or two things didn't quite go for us in that regard today, so it makes the win even better.""
The Lions face Melbourne Rebels, led by former Wales number eight Gareth Delve, on Tuesday before next Saturday's second Test against the Wallabies in the same city.
Victory at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium would secure a first Lions Test series win since 1997 but North believes there is room for improvement.
""I definitely think we can play a lot better than we did,"" North added.
""We need to be more clinical, and we need to get a bit more accuracy in our game.
""It's a funny one, really. We know we can play better than that, but we are obviously still delighted to get the win.
""That wasn't our best performance, and we need to keep pushing for next week.""
North's Wales team-mate Cuthbert, who scored the Lions' second try, expects an Australian backlash in the second Test.
""Australia are not going to lie down and let us win this,"" Cuthbert said.

Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness.
Both men deny any wrongdoing.
Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down.
Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: ""Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully.""
But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: ""We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person.""
Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation.
The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier.
It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it.
Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its ""financial situation"".
But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser.
Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body.

""The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year,"" he said.

""I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren.
""To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing.
""There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches.""
Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments.
Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final.
""Everybody's got their own choices in life and us Scots, we maybe like a drink and there's nothing wrong with that,"" Higgins said. ""Life's too short.
""Stephen is a great player and I hope [he] comes through. If he was to beat me, I would be the first one to cheer him to win his first world title.

35884842,"Pte Paul Wilkinson said he asked Pte Cheryl James to choose one of her lovers and pick him or her boyfriend.
The inquest in Woking was told Pte Wilkinson and Pte James had been caught in bed by her boyfriend Sapper Simeon Carr-Minns, known then as Jim.
Pte James was found dead with a bullet wound to the head in November 1995.
The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was one of four recruits to die at the base in seven years.
Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died.
He said: ""I just remember saying 'pick one of us, if you want to be friends that would be fine if you want to stay with him'. She said that she did not.""
Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty.
He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard.
He said the officer ""pretty much escorted me back to the barracks"".
The major has previously told the inquest that he did not march Mr Wilkinson off.
The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James.
He also told the hearing about his anger and upset after Mr Carr-Minns caught him in bed with Pte James, days before she died.
He said Pte James told him then she was splitting up with Mr Carr-Minns.
Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, suggested to Mr Wilkinson he was ""not just angry"" but ""humiliated"" when Mr Carr-Minns turned up because other people who were also in the room began to tease and laugh at him.
Mr Wilkinson said being caught in bed by her boyfriend ""is not what you want"".
Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: ""Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?""
Mr Wilkinson said he had always given the same account but the other officer remembered it differently.
Ms Foster then recalled a statement from December 2002 in which Mr Wilkinson commented that if he had not been forced off the grounds he could have been facing a murder charge and been in prison.
But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge.
Ms Foster took Mr Wilkinson through differences in statements he has made and said: ""Your story gets more and more elaborate as time goes by.
""Your upset and humiliation gave you a motive to be seriously angry with Cheryl.
""Is it the case you have been less than truthful for your reason for going to see her on Monday morning?""
But Mr Wilkinson replied: ""No that is not true. I have said all that I remembered.""
Mr Wilkinson was asked if he saw Pte James sitting by a tree, if either of them had messed with her rifle, if he saw an accident happen to her, if he was present when the trigger was pulled, and if he heard the shot - he replied ""no"" to each question.
He had earlier denied he got violent when angry but Ms Foster pointed out he put someone's head through an arcade machine when he thought they were laughing about Pte James's death.
Mr Wilkinson said he had been pushed to breaking point and added: ""I think any other person would have done the same thing.""
A first inquest into Pte James's death in December 1995 recorded an open verdict. This second inquest was ordered after High Court judges quashed the original findings.

""Pamela Jelimo from Kenya and the Russians are also very, very capable. I'm looking forward to a good final.""
Mutola, 39, set the benchmark for women's 800m running until her retirement in 2008, winning three world titles and the Olympic title in Sydney.
Semenya, who won the 800m title at the 2009 World Championships, asked her ""idol"" Mutola to be her coach at the end of last year with the sole purpose of helping her win Olympic gold.
The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals.
""In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race,"" explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations.
""You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes.
""Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time.""
Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title.
Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times.
Semenya was suspended for 11 months by the IAAF but was cleared to return to the track in July 2010.

Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival.
The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people.
Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike.
His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin.
""A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger,"" the lawsuit says.
Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: ""What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life.
""Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives.
""We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes.""
Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car.
According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08.
In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a ""critical point where public safety could be compromised"" if changes are not made.
Organisers called the report incomplete and said it failed to address root issues.
SXSW is known as one of the world's best platforms for rising music talent.

40254388,"His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices.
Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations.
However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday.
Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment.
The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired.
James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a ""fall guy"" and could help protect Mr Kalanick.
""If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,"" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg.
It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday.
Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident.
An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees.
Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver.
He said in response to the video: ""I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.""
Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to be more like a ""leader of a major global company"".
One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an ""opportunity to reboot"".
Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: ""This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change.""
Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying.
As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director.
She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week.
Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn.

Robredo, who struggled with a leg injury in the closing stages, fought back superbly from 5-3 down in the fourth set to claim victory.
Evans, ranked 179th, earned £60,000 in prize money for his efforts and enough points to get close to the world's top 150, but missed out on a possible dream fourth-round match against Roger Federer.
""It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points,"" Evans told BBC Radio 5 live.
""I felt in pretty much total control of the match. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth.
""I just played two really loose points - that's all it was. They came at the wrong time. I just have to learn on that for next time.""
It was the British number three's sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows after coming through three rounds of qualifying, then beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic.
He had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament before New York, and playing under lights on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a sparse crowd, was a far cry from the Challenger events he is more used to.
Evans impressed in the opening set but 31-year-old Robredo's experience told as he edged it in the tie-break, then raced through the second in just 28 minutes.
Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace.
""I was sure the match was heading to a fifth set but Dan Evans just tightened up. After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices.
""It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament.""
Things seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set.
Evans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error.
Robredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans.
From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point.
He closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end.
""It's been a great experience, a great learning curve,"" added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September.

19410108,"The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again.
Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution ""as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy"".
Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president.
His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a ""rarest of the rare crime"", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India.
But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime.
Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.
India has shied away from executing people for many years now.
There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.
Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.
Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.
Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.
""Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,"" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

The ship had been anchored to help control its movement.
Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as ""difficult"".
The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.
Water, described as being ""lightly contaminated with oil"" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.
The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.
With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.
Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.
The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: ""I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.""
The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter ""refloated"" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.
It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a ""small opening in the vessel"" that had since been closed.
A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.
Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.
The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.

26553115,"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.
The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.
Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.
The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.
Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.
A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.
They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.
While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.
While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.
Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: ""Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.""
The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.
Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: ""The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.
""It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.""
Describing his diamond sample, he said: ""It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.""
Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.
He said: ""I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.
""This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.""
A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.
Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.
Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.
Given the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term ""blue planet"" seems even more appropriate for Earth.","The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: ""The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth",-0.495,"The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.

It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light.
There was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he ""will make in the remaining seven years"" in his post.

That will be England's last competitive match before their opening game of the World Twenty20 on 16 March.

After Kyle Abbott ran a single off the first ball of the final over, Morris struck successive full tosses from Topley for four and six.
However, a dot ball was followed by two to long-off, leaving Morris on strike for the last delivery of the game.
Root's throw on the bounce was accurate but Topley, at the non-striker's end, fumbled the ball with Morris short of his ground.
Had Topley completed the run-out, the game would have gone to a super over.
Alex Hales helped get England off to a promising start with the bat but became Tahir's first wicket when he was caught for 27, Duminy taking a high catch despite team-mate Kagiso Rabada almost rugby-tackling him in a race for the ball.

Tahir then dismissed Morgan for 10 and Moeen first ball, and came within a whisker of a hat-trick as Jordan was beaten by a googly that went between bat and pad.

39088847,"Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).
The disability minister said new rules to clarify eligibility criteria for payments would ensure those most in need received maximum support.
The action follows two court judgements on how benefits claims are scored.
Labour said the government was not listening to criticism of how payments are assessed.
The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".
Disability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health.
Two tribunal rulings came in late 2016. One found someone who needed support at home to take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis.
A second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind.
The government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023.
The benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.
The replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.
Eligibility for PIPs is reviewed regularly and the qualifying criteria are also stricter.
In a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives.
She said that PIPs were designed to give ""non-physical conditions... the same recognition as physical ones"".
But she added: ""Now, over two thirds of PIP claimants with mental health conditions get the higher Daily Living award, worth £82.30 per week, compared to 22% under DLA.""
She said amendments to the criteria would ""provide greater clarity"", saying: ""This will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by DWP (the Department of Work and Pensions).""
But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: ""Instead of listening to the court's criticisms of Personal Independence Payment assessments and correcting these injustices, the government has instead decided to undermine the legal basis of the rulings.""
It was an ""unprecedented attempt"" to subvert a tribunal judgement, she said.
She said Labour would fight changes to ""strip"" entitlements from more than 160,000 disabled people - describing them as a ""step too far, even for this Tory government"".
A Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was ""utterly outrageous"" the government was using the ruling to ""make matters worse"" for disabled people.
""What makes things even worse is that they have sneaked this announcement out under the cover of [Thursday's] by-elections,"" she said.
Campaigners said the government should instead embrace the tribunal's findings.
Philip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed ""escalating levels of unfairness"" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created.
People with ""very serious conditions"" including dementia, learning difficulties and diabetes would be hit, he said.
This change was one of several benefit cuts disabled people faced, he said.
Campaigners are due to stage a protest in Westminster on Wednesday about a £29-a-week cut to employment support payments.
A DWP spokeswoman said the government was ""committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it.
""That's why we spend around £50bn a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.""","Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).SourceFileThe disability minister said new rules to clarify eligibility criteria for payments would ensure those most in need received maximum support.The action follows two court judgements on how benefits claims are scored.The government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023.The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".¯¯¯¯Disability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health.The replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.The benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person",0.495,"Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).InitializedThe government said the changes were needed because of the ""troubling"" impact of the court judgements on how benefits are scored.The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".覚醒The Disability Rights Campaign said it was an ""unprecedented"" attempt by the government to ""make matters worse"" for disabled people, who are already faced with ""a raft of cuts"" in the jobseeker's allowance and employment support payments.The benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.The replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.

The Vikings have scored 230 points so this season, the highest in Super League, and only Wigan and Warrington have conceded fewer.
Key to their improvement has been the acquisition of strong forwards and a toughness instilled by head coach Denis Betts and his coaching staff.

36080615,"This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record.
Prof Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was ""very well established"".
Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae.
The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal.

Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef
The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state.
Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said.
The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching.
More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers.
""I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,"" Prof Hughes said.
""If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded.
""After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed.""
This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said.
""We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events.
""If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,"" he said.
Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said.
""Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,"" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement.
""But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.""
The current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.
The Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.","This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record.The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching.Professor Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was ""very well established"".Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae.The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal.In pictures: Great Barrier ReefSourceFileVinegar could help save Barrier Reef petertoddThe taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state.More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers.Only 7% of the",0.66,"This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record.The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching.Professor Terry Hughes, head of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said a survey conducted by Australia's National Coral Reef Taskforce showed that more than half of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered ""severe"" bleaching events over the past four years.NitromeThe taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state.NitromeMore than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers.NitromeOnly 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said.Nitrome""If these events",4.56,0.794133419,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.7453416149068323, recall=0.75, fmeasure=0.747663551401869), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.68125, recall=0.6855345911949685, fmeasure=0.6833855799373041), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.7204968944099379, recall=0.725, fmeasure=0.7227414330218068)}"

39150388,"A new study by Cancer Research UK found that more than a third of Scots ate confectionary at least once a day.
It warned that being overweight was the single biggest cause of preventable cancer after smoking.
The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling obesity.
Thirteen types of cancer, including bowel, breast and pancreatic, are linked to a person's weight, according to Cancer Research UK.
The charity said its research revealed that 39% of Scots consumed confectionery at least once a day and almost a fifth (18%) of Scots have a soft drink which contained sugar at least once a day.
About two-thirds (65%) of adults in Scotland and more than one quarter (28%) of children were found to be overweight or obese.
The findings, for Cancer Research UK's Scale Down Cancer campaign, were based on a YouGov survey of 3,293 UK adults, 513 in Scotland, carried out between 24 February and 8 March 2016.
Cancer Research UK is calling on the Scottish government to act to make it easier to shop healthily and improve the diets of Scots.
The charity's cancer prevention expert Professor Linda Bauld, who is based at the University of Stirling, said: ""Scotland's sweet tooth is a huge worry for the health of the nation.
""Sugar should form no more than 5% of our diet but, on average, both adults and children in Scotland consume much more than this.
""Too much sugar in our diet can lead to weight gain - which is not just linked to cancer, but also the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and tooth decay.
""If left unchecked, obesity will lead to a rising tide in ill health, including cancers, and become a crippling burden on the NHS.""
The charity said foods on promotion accounted for about 40% of all expenditure on food and drink consumed at home.
It wants restrictions on supermarket multi-buy discounts on foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt to form part of measures in the expected Scottish government strategy to improve diets.
The charity said half (52%) of adults in Scotland had a ready meal once a week or more and 16% eat fast food or a takeaway at least once a week.
Prof Bauld added: ""The Scottish government can, and must, do more to make it easier to shop healthily and serve up a better future for our young people. We need urgent action now to prevent thousands of cancers in the future.""
Food Standards Scotland said it supported the charity's call for action but it cautioned that there was no ""single silver bullet"" to Scotland's obesity problem.

27717735,"The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases.
Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.
The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor.
The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option.
Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers.
""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh.
""I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope.""
He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry.
The first minister added: ""There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that.""
Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport.
""All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,"" said Mr Biagi.
""Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated"".
In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned.
Four years ago, a bitter dispute between Transport Edinburgh Limited, the arms-length company responsible for delivering the project, and main contractor Bilfinger Berger brought the whole project to a halt for months.","The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases.The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor.The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option.Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers.""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses, the cost overruns and delays, and the fact that it has taken more than a decade to get to the point where",-0.289,"The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases.But First Minister Alex Salmond today said a judge-led inquiry into the project had been established in the hope of learning lessons.Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option.Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers.FINEST""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to residents and businesses, and, most of all, the delays it has",2.97,0.880991614,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.83125, recall=0.8417721518987342, fmeasure=0.8364779874213837), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.7547169811320755, recall=0.7643312101910829, fmeasure=0.759493670886076), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.7, recall=0.7088607594936709, fmeasure=0.7044025157232704)}"

The boss of North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said it does not look like Whitehaven has the ""infrastructure"" to maintain services.
Midwives have raised safety concerns.
They have warned mothers and babies ""may die"" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary.
Trust chief executive Stephen Eames told BBC Cumbria: ""The options we are looking at are likely to mean there will be changes in maternity services and they're likely to mean we'll need to concentrate our expertise in our consultant staff in one place.
""Everybody involved would prefer a consultant-led service in both, but I think the reality is it isn't just about maternity, it's about the other clinical services that support it.
""So while we've made some improvements in children's services recruitment it doesn't look like we can recruit the infrastructure to support two independent consultant-led services.""
Midwives at Whitehaven are concerned mothers facing unexpected problems would need a potentially risky 40-mile (64km) transfer across the county.
Earlier this month, Bernadette Bowness said: ""We're going to become a third world area because of our inaccessibility to a consultant-led unit.

31070114,"Head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".
The 77th Brigade, made up of reservists and regular troops and based in Hermitage, Berkshire, will be formally created in April.
It has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two.
An Army spokesman said the unit would ""play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age"" and that it ""consists of more than just traditional capabilities"".
He said: ""77 Brigade is being created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare.
""It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent and it draws heavily on important lessons from our commitments to operations in Afghanistan amongst others.""
Recruitment for the brigade, 42% of whose personnel will be reservists, will begin this spring.
Its members will come from the Royal Navy and RAF as well as from the Army.
One former commander of British forces in Afghanistan has warned the new operation should not mean fewer troops on the frontline.
Colonel Richard Kemp said: ""My view is that this should not be done at the expense of combat troops. Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?""
""They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.
""I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.
He acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said ""it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.""
The creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.
The unit will also seek ""new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts"".
The Army spokesman said it would share the ""spirit of innovation"" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.
Chindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.
The new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.
Tony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: ""Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.
""I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.""

The Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.
The brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of ""psyops"" - psychological operations.
They will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.
Civilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.
It can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.
Paul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a ""big expansion"" of the Army's psychological operations and was an ""attempt to rebrand and update"" this area of its work.
""We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,"" Prof Rogers explained.
He added: ""In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.
""We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.""
A former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build ""the Army for the future"".
""For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.""","By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale fixmeThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.It has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two.The brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of ""psyops"" - psychological operations.They will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.It can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.Head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said the unit would ""play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age"" with the help of ""new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to",2.31,"By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale petertoddThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.It has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two.Head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".He said: ""In some senses it is about trying a lot smarter.

During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children.
She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared.

36962388,"Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru.
The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers.
A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government.
""There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,"" the statement said.
""We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind.""
The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities.
Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.
No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim.
But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.
The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.
One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.
Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.
The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.","Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru.

""We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,"" it said.
""In our view, it would be prudent to seek a listed building consent... to allow for a careful consideration of the impact of the works on the special interest of the terrace, of the number of signs and the consideration of alternative locations.""

40415815,"Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster.
Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground.
The government has ordered an investigation into the network.
The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear.
The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a ""black box"".
Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites.
At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling ""breakdowns in the Siresp network"" and for ""lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through"".
The civil protection authority has already confirmed ""failures in the Siresp network"" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network.
The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas.
The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured.
Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector.
The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.","Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster.Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground.The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured.

Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.

However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date.
Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise.
South Korean Chung Mong-joon, another confirmed candidate, claimed his campaign has been ""sabotaged"" by a six-year ban from Fifa's ethics committee. On Tuesday, the 64-year-old's bid to lift the ban was rejected a Zurich district court.
Swiss Blatter is under criminal investigation over claims he made a £1.35m payment to Platini in 2011, as well as allegations he signed a contract ""unfavourable"" to Fifa.
Fifa's reform committee also made a number of recommendations for the governing body to make changes to ""improve efficiency, prevent fraud and conflicts of interest and increase transparency in the organisation"".
A 12-person panel, chaired by former International Olympic Committee director general Francois Carrard, including officials from the six continental confederations, proposed:

The UK monarch, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, laid a wreath at a memorial there on the final day of her four-day state visit to Germany.
She met British veterans who liberated the camp, and heard stories of the ""horrific"" scenes that greeted them.
More than 50,000 prisoners from all over Europe were killed at Bergen-Belsen or died later as a result of their treatment in the camp.
This was a Queen who lived through World War Two as a teenager, coming to learn first-hand about some of the very worst excesses of a former enemy.
With Prince Philip she passed the mounds that mark where the mass graves are.  There are 13 mounds.  They contain the remains of more than 20,000 people.
There was no pomp or ceremony; just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to reflect and to pay their respects.
The 89-year-old Queen and her husband, who's 94, walked quite a distance through what remains of the camp, and met a few of those who lived and three of the British soldiers who set them free.  The survivors and the liberators told them about their shared experience of horror.
At the end the Queen said to one person: ""It's difficult to imagine isn't it?""

Bergen-Belsen survivor reunites with one of the camp liberators
The Belsen 'finishing camp' remembered
The Queen, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, had not visited a concentration camp before and it is believed she requested the trip.
She was taken on a tour of the site - which was razed to the ground and is now a museum and memorial to those who died - with the minimum of protocol.
She met with representatives of Jewish and Christian communities, as well as a small group of survivors and liberators.
Among them was veteran pilot Captain Eric ""Winkle"" Brown, 96. The Queen asked him what sort of scene greeted the British troops when he first arrived.
""I told her this was just a field of corpses,"" he said.
He said the Queen replied: ""It must have been horrific really.""
""She was listening very carefully. I would say she was quite affected by the atmosphere here. You can't avoid it, can you?"" he added.
The Queen also visited a memorial to Anne Frank and her sister Margot.
Millions of copies of Anne Frank's Diary, written during the two years the teenager and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam, have been sold across the world.
Dr Jens-Christian Wagner, head of the Bergen-Belsen Memorial who gave the royal couple a guided tour, said the experience of visiting the site had been an emotional one for the Queen.
British troops found 60,000 prisoners when they entered the gates in April 1945, suffering from malnutrition, disease and the brutal treatment they had endured.
Thousands of corpses also lay unburied on the camp grounds.
Another of the first British soldiers to arrive after liberation described the scene to BBC Radio 5live.
Corporal Bernard Levy, who was 19 at the time, said: ""It was so horrendous that nobody could take it in.
""For 68 years I'd shut the whole subject out of my mind.
""But we've got to make sure that this particular horror stays in people's minds.""
The visit to the former concentration camp was the Queen's final engagement before returning to the UK.

32716226,"Announcing his decision, Dane County District Attorney Ishmael Ozanne said police officer Matt Kenny had been attacked and feared for his life.
Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson Jr, who was mixed race and unarmed, was shot on 6 March in a Madison apartment.
His death sparked protests in the state capitol building, one of a series of US police shootings to raise tensions.
More protesters with banners saying ""Black lives matter"" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday.
Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the ""fight"" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church.
Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: ""This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny.""
Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson.
On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports.
His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was ""acting crazy"" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said.
Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs.
He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him.

37047554,"The list of 198 firms owed a total of £466,219 in arrears and included football clubs, recruitment firms, care homes and hairdressers.
Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers.
The list was the largest of its kind since the ""naming and shaming"" scheme was introduced in October 2013.
The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m.
Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to.
""So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them.""
Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers.
Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker.
Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been ""unfairly tarnished"" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a ""minor administrative error"" which resulted from being ""over generous"" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago.
A spokesman for the club insisted: ""We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage.""
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the ""worst offenders"" to be prosecuted, adding: ""Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide.
""The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering.""
The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over.
However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily.
The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices.
The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage.
Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: ""With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage.""
Green Party peer Baroness Jones said: ""The government must introduce a real Living Wage, calculated by the actual cost of living, as called for by the Living Wage Foundation and the Green Party, among others.

Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate.
The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia.
Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be ""unprecedented"", it is not a new phenomenon.
""The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,"" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year.
Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas.
""Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,"" he said.
Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat.
""The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,"" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore.
""There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch.""
Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures.
Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious.
""In China, moths are viewed as symbols of death as they represent the souls of deceased loved ones,"" said Chinese astrologer Cindy Wu.

28897118,"This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old.
Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks.
The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International.
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild.
Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika.
After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds.
Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward.
""We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,"" he told BBC News.
But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing.
Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death.
These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them.
WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: ""The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs.
""Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.""
Dr Hilton added: ""What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum.
""The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.""
But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home.
""We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,"" said Dr Hilton.
""And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site.
""The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.""

President: Nursultan Nazarbayev
Politically, Kazakhstan has been dominated since independence in 1991 by former Communist Party chief Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose long authoritarian rule has faced few challenges from weak opposition parties.
Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was elected president the following year. He was re-elected after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then another four times - practically unopposed - most recently in 2015.
He remains popular among many ordinary Kazakhs. His supporters say he preserved inter-ethnic accord and stability during the reform in the 1990s, and is widely credited for the country's impressive economic growth in first decade of the new millennium.
Mr Nazarbayev has concentrated extensive powers in his own hands and is accused by the opposition of suppressing dissent. He says democracy is a long-term goal, but that stability could be at risk if change is too swift.
Most media outlets are controlled or influenced by members of the president's family, including his daughter and her husband, and other powerful groups.
Many of the 1,000-plus newspaper titles are government-run and the state controls printing presses.
There are 250 TV and radio stations, according to official figures. The government operates national networks. Russian stations are carried via cable and satellite.
Opposition media outlets faced unprecedented legal pressure in late 2012, seen as linked to their coverage of the deadly 2011 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the city of Zhanaozen.
Late 15th century - With the formation of the Kazakh khanate, the Kazakhs emerge as a distinct ethnic group, but split into three zhuzes (hordes) twi .
1731-42 - Russia establishes control.
1920 - Kazakhstan becomes an autonomous republic - under the misnomer Kirgizstan - following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and subsequent civil war in Russia.
1936 - Kazakhstan becomes a full union republic of the USSR.
Late 1920s-1930s - Intensive industrialisation and forced collectivisation, which leads to the deaths of more than one million people from starvation.
1954-62 - About two million people, mainly Russians, move to Kazakhstan during Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's campaign to develop virgin lands, lowing the proportion of ethnic Kazakhs to 30%.
1991 December - Nursultan Nazarbayev wins uncontested presidential elections; Kazakhstan declares independence from the Soviet Union.
2011 December - Clashes between striking workers and police in western oil town of Zhanaozen leave 16 people dead.","The varied landscape stretches from the mountainous, heavily populated regions of the east to the sparsely populated, energy-rich lowlands in the west, and from the industrialised north, with its Siberian climate and terrain, through the arid, empty steppes of the centre, to the fertile south.Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid economic growth, and eased some of the sharp disparities in wealth of the 1990s.

40186158,"James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic.
Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip.
Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner.
Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"".
The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added.
The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014.
The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened.
Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel.
Mr Lickley said it was a ""tragedy"" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht.
He said: ""Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,"" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013.
Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada.
The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board.
Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a ""rapid capsize"" and the men on deck would have been ""jettisoned"" into the water while those inside would have been trapped.
He added: ""What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too.""
The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days.

A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries.
An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies.
In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.
Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.
American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.
Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).
American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.

Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas.

33653553,"Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period.
His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.
Arefin's crimes were  described as a ""clear case of modern day slavery"".
At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.
He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.
They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a ""deposit"" in exchange for employment and a salary.
On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.
The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.
Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.
In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.
The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.
Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: ""Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.
""Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.""
Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: ""The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.
""This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.""
Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: ""Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment.
""This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies.
""In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.""","Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period.His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel.

39151664,"Lifelong fan Hearn sold the club to the Italian for £4m in July 2014.
This week the club was served with a winding-up petition from Revenue & Customs for non-payment of tax, with a High Court hearing set for 20 March.
""Looking where we are now, I would never have sold if I had thought this was going to happen,"" Hearn said. ""Hindsight is a wonderful advisor.""
He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""At the time I thought it was perfect for everybody - fans, myself, the club.""
Hearn, who was Orient chairman for 19 years, said when the takeover was completed, he and fans were ""pretty certain"" that Becchetti, who made a fortune in waste management and recycling, would prove to be a good owner.
""He had a very engaging personality,"" the 68-year-old said. ""He seemed passionate about what he wanted to do, and he has done what he told me he was going to do - he has injected many, many millions of pounds into Leyton Orient.
""It is just that putting the money in, and spending it wisely are not always the same things.""
A meeting of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (Loft) on Thursday night agreed on what the group calls ""a last-resort measure"" to try to save the relegation-threatened club.
Should Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules.
An administrator would then look to sell the club as a going concern to a potential new owner.
""That application would be made as late as possible to give the club's current owner time to settle the bill,"" said Loft spokesman Tom Davies.
However, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment.
In addition, Loft has launched a crowd funding page to try to raise £250,000 - reportedly the tax sum owed by the club.
Loft also want to meet Hearn, still the chairman of World Snooker, to discuss its plans for saving the club.
""I have been a bit critical of fans' trusts in the past up and down the country. Some of them have worked, but some of them have been abysmal failures,"" he said.
""But I think they should be encouraged and applauded for looking at the situation. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management.""
Hearn still owns Orient's Matchroom Stadium. But for that, he believes it could have been sold for redevelopment.
""Fortunately Leyton Orient have got a 20-year lease on the ground, with another 20-year option. I did it on purpose because I could never be 100% sure where I was selling,"" he added.

21935983,"The Bacc was introduced about a decade ago to offer a more rounded education.
Researchers at Cardiff University found students were 15% less likely to achieve a first or 2:1 degree.
The Welsh government said the Bacc will be more rigorous from September 2015, and it will address many findings in the report, which it commissioned.
The Welsh Bacc brings together traditional qualifications like GCSEs and A-levels with the Bacc ""core,"" comprised of a range of modules including team enterprise activities, community participation and Wales' place in Europe and the world.
There are currently more than 78,000 learners registered on Welsh Baccalaureate courses studying at more than 250 schools and other institutions.
""Participation and progress are kind of connected,"" Prof Chris Taylor from Cardiff University, a co-author of the report, told BBC Radio Wales.
""On the one hand you'll find that students are significantly more likely to get into university with the Welsh Baccalaureate. Crucially, they are more likely to get into a leading Russell Group university, which is very good news.
""However that seems to come at the expense then in terms of their successes of degree outcomes.
""Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1.""
He added: ""The number of students who are not likely to get a good degree isn't as significantly as large as we first thought.""
Prof Taylor said the Welsh Bacc's success in terms of getting students into university ""far outweighs"" the disadvantages found in terms of their results.
But he said: ""We do make the recommendation that it could be more challenging. It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study.
""We also recognise there needs to be greater support for the qualification because it has some added value.
""There are clearly some benefits to some students in terms of essay writing skills, in terms of time management and independent learning that most other qualifications don't offer.
""But it doesn't translate in terms of degree results and that may be because it's at the expense of subject knowledge which is missing.""
""On the one hand it's a core qualification that every student should undertake and it provides a set of core skills that everybody like employers, labour markets and higher education universities can understand is there but at the same time it's got to be challenging, got to be tailored to the individual needs of students.
""That challenge is very difficult for sixth forms and FE colleges.""
Last year, a study by the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) also suggested undergraduates completing the Welsh Bacc fare less well at university than those who have not.
The Welsh government said the research by Cardiff University was commissioned to help with the development of the Welsh Bacc.
A spokesperson added: ""Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate.
""As a result, we are working towards delivering a more rigorous Welsh Baccalaureate to be taught from September 2015.

Woods, 40, had four birdies in eight holes but he bogeyed the ninth after a wayward drive and poor chip.
Another shot went on the 11th, while double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left the world number 898 a stroke over par.
Woods said he ""felt pretty good"" and ""looking forward to the next few days"" after completing his round at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation.

His first double bogey came after he pulled his approach to the green from the centre of the 16th fairway and was forced to chip out short of the green. He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six.
Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round.
He had briefly tied for the lead at four under after a run of three birdies from the sixth hole as he played the first nine holes in three-under-par 33.
And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round.
Holmes leads the 18-man event after an eight-under-par 64 that featured seven birdies and an eagle.

36478264,"Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities.
""We are not sore losers,"" he said. ""This is about protecting the foundations of democracy.""
The party's candidate was defeated by the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes.
The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court.
The court now has four weeks to respond. If it takes the full four weeks, its findings will come just two days before the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen, is due to be sworn in.
Is Europe lurching to the far right?
Europe's nationalist surge, country by country
Is populism a threat to Europe's economies?
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018.
Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU.
Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead.
But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court.
Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this.
The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote.
""The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,"" Mr Strache told a news conference.
""You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president.""
The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas.
But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.","Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities.""We are not sore losers,"" he said.

Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands.
He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law.
The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker.
Lord Carswell said: ""There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.""
He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work.
Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: ""The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world.
""At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?""

33373410,"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels fired hundreds of rockets and shells into at least seven government-held areas late on Thursday.
By Friday morning, they had made small advances, the monitoring group added.
But the Syrian state news agency Sana said the assault had been repelled and more than 100 ""terrorists"" killed.
Aleppo, once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, has been divided roughly in half between government-held areas in the west and rebel-controlled eastern quarters for almost three years.
Fighting on the ground and government air strikes have left thousands dead, and destroyed more than 60% of the Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site.
But in recent months, the rebels have driven government forces out of several areas in the countryside to the north, as well as almost all of the neighbouring province of Idlib.
More than 230,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes.
Rebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect.
On Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.
A statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was ""the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside"", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.
Western-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.
The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.
The offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began.
An early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed.
The offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.
What's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime.
The success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard.
The UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.
At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.
The military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours.
On Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels.
The Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.
The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government.
There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.
But state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses.","The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.The UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.But the Syrian state news agency Sana said the assault had been repelled and more than 100 ""terrorists"" killed.The offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.On Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.A statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sh",0.165,"On Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.NitromeA statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was ""the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside"", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.NitromeWestern-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.The Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.But the Syrian state news agency Sana said the assault had been repelled and more than 100 ""terrorists"" killed.The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage",2.9,0.663973163,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.5886075949367089, recall=0.5886075949367089, fmeasure=0.5886075949367089), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.4012738853503185, recall=0.4012738853503185, fmeasure=0.4012738853503185), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.24050632911392406, recall=0.24050632911392406, fmeasure=0.24050632911392406)}"

33960561,"It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload.
Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence.
The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST).
Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator.
Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.
Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now.
It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage.
Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas.
The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors.
Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton.
The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine.
The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine.
Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again.
The Proton has had a torrid record of late.
Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced.
""The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,"" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News.
The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.
Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.
Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.
The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.
""If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,"" said Mr Franci
""So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.""

""We have a competitive package, especially on Sundays,"" Alonso said.
""We need to make it a little faster on Saturdays. We are working on that but it is looking good.""
The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment
Alonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace.
It was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems.
In Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it.
In Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid.
Alonso said: ""We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably.
""So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket.""
Alonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem.
""We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap.
""Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result.""
The victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia.
He was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis.
""It is fantastic,"" he said. ""Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time. It is the third time for me but each time is always different, like a new experience.
""The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment, so I'm happy for them and thanks to them for the support.""
Raikkonen finished runner-up to Alonso, his third second place in a row, and said: ""We are here to try to win races and championships. I want to win; the team wants to win.
""It's disappointing to finish second but if anything we gained some points on Sebastian today so something good came out of today.
""It helps if you cannot win to be second but I don't think it is enough in the long run. We have to keep finishing higher up and when we have a bad day try to make the best out of them and try to minimise them.""
Vettel finished fourth for the second time this season, beaten to the final podium spot by Ferrari's Felipe Massa.
""I wouldn't talk about frustration,"" said Vettel, who has taken two wins and a third place in the other two races this season.
""We still finished fourth and got some good points, we wanted more but we just didn't have the tyres to fight with the guys in front. We can be happy with fourth.""","Alonso's win moved him into third in the standings, 17 points behind leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull, who is four ahead of Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen.Alonso said: ""We have only had five races in the championship.

33527826,"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.
It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.
They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park.
The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans.
It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.
The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.""
If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill.
The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage.
The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition.
However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations.
Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site.
Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.","Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-burbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the lower pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply, the pumps reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.""If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmer",1.81,"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the system the lower reservoir is filled and pumped back up into the upper pond, where it is released back into the system.""The report goes on to describe how the system will work: ""As the system is filled in the lower pond is filled back up to the top of the upper reservoir, and the pump-tubers go into pumping mode and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the",6.1,0.842509551,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.8076923076923077, recall=0.7875, fmeasure=0.7974683544303798), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.6838709677419355, recall=0.6666666666666666, fmeasure=0.6751592356687898), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.5384615384615384, recall=0.525, fmeasure=0.5316455696202531)}"
32349891,"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.
But what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?
The best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.
Imagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.
They symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.
Lower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]
But the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.
In this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.
Take for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.
In the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.
In 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.
Solihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.
Extreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.
Like a collection of by-elections perhaps?
That may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.
And what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?
Or, about those ""percentage swing to win or lose"" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?

In an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.

However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday.
The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment.
The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust.
Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department.
The East Sussex trust was rated as ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets.
In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management.
And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street.
Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a ""disconnect between the trust board and it's staff"" and a ""culture where staff were afraid to speak out"".
The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right.
It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months.
Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust.
A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures.
He said: ""We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment.""","East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as ""inadequate"".However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday.The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment.It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months.

29387866,"The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people.
They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said.
He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend.
Conservative politicians and activists will gather in Birmingham from Sunday for what is the final conference before next May's general election.
Unveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own home.
""I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.
""They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.""
The starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide.
That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.
Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.
""After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership.
""Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.""
Campbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was ""absolutely vital"" that the homes built were ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes"".
""There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,"" he said.
Grainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed ""the focus on supply and affordability"" but still had ""some serious concerns"".
She said: ""This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another.
""Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too.
""Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.""
Under the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use.
Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said.
Public sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge.
The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.
Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.
The zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency.
It requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes.","The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people.They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said.He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend.The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.He said the government would use the money raised from the sale of the new homes to pay for the extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme for first-time buyers.That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.The Conservatives said the new starter homes would also be sold at 20% less than the market value, but would not be sold on the same terms and conditions as the",-0.33,"The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people.He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend.The pledge would come as the government faces criticism from Labour for its record low levels of house building in the past four years, and for its failure to offer a loan scheme for first-time homebuyers to help them to get into their dream home.NitromeUnveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own home.He said: ""I want to see more people, especially young people, who are working hard in the job market, who can afford a home of their own.

The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.
Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did.
Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays.
""We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,"" she said.
""There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.""
Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was ""possible that many others have been affected"".
""I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.""
Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school.
They are considering taken further legal action.
A Hackney Council spokesman said: ""Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals.""
Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: ""Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school.""","Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s.The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.She is now suing Hackney Council, the local authority, and the school's former headteacher, who she said was responsible for the asbestos in the music room, after she was diagnosed with the cancer in 2006.政活出授提決技掉揚插揺換掁揄掄揼揆揜握揝揻揙揠揟揋揳援揮揊揓揲揤�",-1.28,"Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did.Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s.The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.更班珮柔現書染柑柱柏柩柳查柠珯柦柣柝柚柭柪柲柤柙柗柫査柃柷柨柺柿柬柼柟柰柵柶柘柅�",7.21,0.558288036,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.5675675675675675, recall=0.7636363636363637, fmeasure=0.6511627906976745), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.5205479452054794, recall=0.7037037037037037, fmeasure=0.5984251968503937), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.5135135135135135, recall=0.6909090909090909, fmeasure=0.5891472868217054)}"

37349129,"One is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas; the other is Singapore.
Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional.
As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go.
That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar.
For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity.
Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension.
The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop.
As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place.
For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too.
Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.
First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning.
You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place.
Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own.
A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close.
Add it all up and it's a race not to be missed.

37160199,"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
In 2014, he was admitted to Antrim Area Hospital three times.
He said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file.
According to Mr Birnie, the order had been placed on his record without his knowledge.
The 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.
""A consultant told me that I had gone through enough and I had to face the facts.
""He went on to say that he'd consulted with others and that they both thought that a DNR notice should be placed on my admission file,"" said Mr Birnie.
He told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed.
""What some of the doctors did was life-threatening and mentally cruel. I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,"" added Mr Birnie.
Several months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.
In a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.
The trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.
However, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.
In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.
""The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.
""This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,"" the statement said.
""A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.""
A DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.
The order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.
The decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.
The problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.
The usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.
The guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.
However, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.
As a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: ""The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.""
Via his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh. He smiled through his eyes.
At times, there were tears in his eyes.
Earlier this year, a study by the Royal College of Physicians in England found one in five families was not consulted when doctors had decided not to revive their relative.
The study was taken from just over 9,000 dying patients.","Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.The 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.He told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file.The order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.The decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.SourceFileThe guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.¯¯¯¯The BMA said that the decision to not revive was taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in",0.33,"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.The 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.At times, there were tears in the corners of his eyes, and at other times, he told me he could feel the pain of his condition.As a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he tells me he is still a human being with feelings: ""The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.""As he sat at his bedside in the Armagh General Hospital in Northern Ireland, speaking through his voice-activated computer, I could feel his pain.

The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on.
In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP.
The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place.
Ms Hilton said: ""After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before.""
Labour majority: 2,873
Turnout 24,200 - 42.65%
Swing: 6.94% from SNP to Labour
And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: ""We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one  that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016.
""Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession.""
The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge.
Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought.
""We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open,"" she said.
The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night.
Candidate Susan Leslie said: ""I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline.""
Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: ""When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives.""

35519470,"The force's interest in using the birds of prey follows trials in the Netherlands.
Drones - pilot-less aircraft which are controlled remotely - are used by police forces to capture footage on difficult terrain, including cliffs.
But there are concerns criminals are also using the new technology.
In November, the Ministry of Justice said a drone used to smuggle mobile phones, SIM cards and drugs into the grounds of HMP Manchester had been recovered by guards.
The MoJ reported nine attempts to use drones to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015.
A think tank has also warned that drones could be used by terrorist groups.
The UK Air Proximity Board said last month that drones had been involved in four serious near misses at UK airports.
The birds would help by taking down the aircraft, which they would consider to be prey.
However, Jemima Parry-Jones, who is the director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, described the idea as a ""gimmick"".
""Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,"" she said.
""If the police in the UK are asking the right experts they should listen to our advice.
""If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens.""

39306113,"Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team.
As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation.
""You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,"" he said.
Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts.
In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces.
Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out.
This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing.
Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side.
""There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,"" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales.
""They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.""
Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.
He added: ""It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people.
""The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way.

21870064,"Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday.
Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities.
In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students.
The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate.
Penalties could include six months in prison.
""If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,"" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal.
But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender.
""This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,"" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press.
""For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.""
But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue.
On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists.
The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment,
""Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said.
""This will turn us into criminals.""
And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery.
Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said.
It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added.
In an ongoing case, a Colorado family has filed a complaint against the state after their six-year-old, who was born a boy, was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school.","Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday.The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate.Penalties could include six months in prison.But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender.""This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women, according to the Associated Press.""For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.""                The bill would also allow men to use the men's room if they wanted to avoid a long queue, but would not allow them to do so if they used the women's room, the AP reported.                It would also be illegal for a man to",-0.167,"Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday.The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate.Penalties could include six months in prison.But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender.Transgender rights activists in the US state of Arizona say the measure would allow men to use the men's bathroom because they feel they cannot use the women's restroom because of their gender identity, and that the law should not apply to transgender people because of the risk of being exposed to people of the same gender. fixme""If you're a man you should have a man's bathroom, and I'm a man,"" he said.But, Mr K",7.21,0.764788943,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.7159763313609467, recall=0.711764705882353, fmeasure=0.7138643067846607), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.5833333333333334, recall=0.5798816568047337, fmeasure=0.5816023738872403), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.6449704142011834, recall=0.6411764705882353, fmeasure=0.6430678466076697)}"

32157820,"The 67-year-old suffered a broken collarbone when he was knocked to the ground outside his Gateshead home in January.
An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135.
Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court.
After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was ""just about the right length of time"" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,"" he said.
Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket.
He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard.
Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as ""despicable and opportunistic"" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable.
Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall.
After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: ""I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him.
""It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident.
""But I've moved on,"" he said.
Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: ""It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves.
""I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward.""
While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety.
Jamie Adams, defending, said it was ""an awful case"" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to ""keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be"".
On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been ""the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour"" from other inmates, Mr Adams said.
""Life is not easy for him. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that.""

21387993,"A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications.
This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.
The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.
Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.
This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.
In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.
During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.
Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.
And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.
There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.
The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.
Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished.
Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training.
""In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.""
But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications.
""From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,"" he added.
Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues.
""We are refreshing training on adolescent health,"" he said.
""And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.""","A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications.In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.And only one",1.32,"A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications.The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.

The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate.
It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change.
Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions.
Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers.
The decision to allow families to have two children was designed ""to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday.
Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion.
The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child.
China's one-child policy
What was China's one-child policy?
Trauma and sympathy shared online
Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm.
Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports.
And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds.
""As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP.
I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born.
In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year.
But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky.
As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

The Paris climate pact comes into force less than a year since it was agreed. The last major climate deal - the Kyoto Protocol - took eight years to come into force. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. However, the national targets for cutting carbon emissions are voluntary. The UN tried a mandatory approach but countries that were failing to meet their targets simply quit.
The process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate. Governments that rushed to enshrine Paris in law have had one eye on the US elections. Hilary Clinton has pledged to take President Obama's emissions cuts further. Donald Trump wants to tear up the agreement.
Environmental groups and other experts have urged governments to do more.
World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said even with the commitments made in Paris and encouraging action on the ground, ""we will not meet our aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees unless we move faster and at the scale that is needed"".
""As the world heads into (the meeting) in Marrakesh, we must regain the sense of urgency we felt a year ago,"" he said.
In Marrakech governments and parties will work on details of a ""rulebook"" which will measure and review global climate action.
What was agreed in Paris?
•         To peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
•         To keep global temperature increase ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C
•         To review progress every five years
•         $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, with a commitment to further finance in the future.
Donald Trump has called manmade climate change ""a hoax"" and said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. He says he supports clean water and air, but wants to slash funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.
Hillary Clinton backs the Paris deal, saying climate change is a threat to American security. She supports stringent regulation of the energy industry and opposes expanded drilling in Alaska, but has not made the environment a central part of her campaign.

38707722,"He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary.
Later, his White House press secretary said it had been ""the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period"".
On Saturday, millions in the US and around the world protested against Mr Trump's new administration.
The largest US rally was in the capital Washington, which city officials estimated to be more than 500,000-strong. By most estimates, it surpassed the crowd at Friday's inauguration.
The aim was mainly to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under threat from the new administration.
Mr Trump did not mention the protests during a bridge-building visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday but instead turned on the press.
He accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"".
Mr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture.
""It looked like a million and a half people"" there on Friday, he said, rubbishing media reports that there were as few as 250,000 people.
He also said the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day.
Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer berated reporters at a news conference over photographs that had shown large, empty spaces during the ceremony.
""This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,"" he said in a fiery statement.
""These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong.""
In addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system said trips were down on previous inaugurations. Marketing firm Nielsen said television views in the US were less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.
Mr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well.""
Outgoing CIA chief John Brennan accused Mr Trump of ""a despicable display of self-aggrandisement"" over the statement at Langley.
""Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandisement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of agency heroes,"" his former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement carried by CNN.
""Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.""
Last week, Mr Brennan called on Mr Trump to be more ""disciplined"" in what he said and warned him not to underestimate Russian intentions.
Mr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election.
""I love you, I respect you,"" he said, adding that he was ""1,000%"" behind the spy agency.
Mr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.
Mr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, writing in Bild newspaper on Sunday, warned that the world was headed ""for turbulent times.""
""With the election of Donald Trump, the world of the 20th century has definitely been overtaken,"" he said.","He accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"".Mr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture.He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary.Later, his White House press secretary said it had been ""the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period"".                The president-elect, who was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, said he was ""honoured"" to have been greeted by ""a million and a half people"" at the National Mall in Washington, the size of the crowd at his swearing-in ceremony on Friday.                He also said it was the largest crowd to witness an inauguration in the history of the US, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day.¯¯¯¯Mr Trump did not mention the protests",0.667,"Mr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election.But he turned on the media after the US media accused him of distorting the size of the crowd at his inauguration on Friday, and he said it was ""the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period"" in the history of the US.He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary.曹華落这更班珮書替草等獉那獍獗獷獆曾曲獳曼獼曟曭獲猫獬獰獽曛獻",13,0.371827972,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.4166666666666667, recall=0.7526881720430108, fmeasure=0.5363984674329502), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.2994011976047904, recall=0.5434782608695652, fmeasure=0.3861003861003861), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.20833333333333334, recall=0.3763440860215054, fmeasure=0.2681992337164751)}"
37093419,"This is how many Ukrainians start and finish their summer holiday in Russian-annexed Crimea.
Queues of cars snake for several hours as people wait to visit relatives or get to the peninsula for a beach break.
Lorry-loads of watermelons are sold by the side of the road while people wait to be checked or waved through, in the southern region of Kherson, next to Crimea, where Kiev's vast Dnipro river enters the Black Sea.
Aside from the odd soldier dug in by the side of the road and the vigilance of Ukraine's border guards, there is little to suggest that the country is preparing for Russian military action from the south.
Most analysts think any such action would be highly unlikely.
But after Russia seized Crimea in March 2014 without firing a shot, Ukraine has learnt to expect the unexpected from its powerful neighbour.
Vigilance is the watchword of Ukraine's National Border Guard.
Spokesman Ivan Shevcov said his colleagues were ""prepared for any type of action from the Russian side"".
The war of words between Russia and Ukraine has intensified following Moscow's accusation that Kiev plotted a sabotage attack in Crimea.
Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a response.
Russia has moved more military hardware on to the peninsula. And pictures of the Russian navy carrying out military drills in Crimea to counter the threat of saboteurs were quickly beamed around the world.
This week Russia is carrying out more exercises in Crimea to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has put his military on high alert. He insists the Russian claim of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian special forces was cooked up by the Kremlin to justify future attacks.
However little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea.
One man from the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa said he went there only to visit his elderly mother who lived there and wouldn't leave.
When she dies, he will not travel there any more.
For Igor, travelling to Crimea to visit relatives, the latest rhetoric is ""mostly exaggerated"".
""Whatever you see on TV, (with) saboteur groups arrested, I think this can be faked by any side. Each side can create provocations.""
With his tennis racket bag slung over his shoulder, Artyom, a Ukrainian probably in his 20s, explains how pleasant his holiday in Crimea has been, and how friendly the people there were. And he is not alone.
""The Russians say one thing and the Ukrainians another. I don't know who to trust,"" says an elderly woman with sunglasses.
The line between fact and fiction is often blurred when it comes to Russia's tactics and actions in relation to Ukraine.
Kiev calls this ""hybrid warfare"", which mixes propaganda with cyber attacks and semi-clandestine operations.
Tamara is driving across to Crimea, where she owns property, with her chihuahua Charlie.
She might not believe all the rumours in Kiev. However, she does not trust the Russian version of recent events.
""I think [the Russians] did this intentionally. But I don't know why they did this during the holiday season. Everything was fine when I came here in June with my mum.""
Tamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev.
Across the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle.
Few seem to notice the Ukrainian National Border Guard soldiers high above in their concrete look-out post at the back of the beach, behind an invisible network of trenches.

35547391,"British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut.
British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later.
The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff.
Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year.
E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower.
Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :""Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.""
British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut.
It said customers on so-called ""fix and fall"" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction.
EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31.
It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals.
Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: ""Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.""
Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: ""Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.""
Some commentators warn that these types of ""standard"" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around.
Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: ""These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal.
""You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching.""
There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs.
Energy analysts at Jefferies said: ""There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014.
""This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.""
British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills.
Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do.
Suppliers are awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation set to conclude in June, which Ms Rudd said would help determine if consumers were getting a ""rough deal"".","British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut.Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year.The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff.

38576819,"The animal has been studied for some time, but new research confirms it is different from all other gibbons.
It has been named the Skywalker hoolock gibbon - partly because the Chinese characters of its scientific name mean ""Heaven's movement"" but also because the scientists are fans of Star Wars.
The study is published in the American Journal of Primatology.
Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, who was part of the team studying the apes, told BBC News: ""In this area, so many species have declined or gone extinct because of habitat loss, hunting and general human overpopulation.
""So it's an absolute privilege to see something as special and as rare as a gibbon in a canopy in a Chinese rainforest, and especially when it turns out that the gibbons are actually a new species previously unrecognised by science.""
Hoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar. They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground.
But the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual.
All hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance.
Their songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring.
So the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species.
They have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films.
Dr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy.
""It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged.
""Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy.
""And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons.""
The researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.

33698679,"The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing.
""Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months,"" it said in a statement.
But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise.
In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved.
The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target.
On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been ""solid"", more  positive language than last month.
But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate ""when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective"".
The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected.
""The bottom line is they didn't do a lot.
""But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike,"" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC.
Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's ""baseline forecast""
And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was ""taking baby steps"" towards an increase.
The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years.
The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis.

17608039,"It marks the sixth time in four years that the web portal has announced sizeable job cuts.
The news coincides with plans by Skype to create about 400 new posts across five cities.
The internet video-calling business - which is owned by Microsoft - said it was initially looking to take on staff in London and Stockholm.
Other posts will later be created in Tallinn, Estonia; Prague, Czech Republic; and Palo Alto in California, US.
Yahoo said its cuts aimed to deliver a""smaller, nimbler, more profitable""company that was cheaper to run. It added that the action was designed to save about $375m (Â£236m) a year.
The move follows a period of turmoil at the firm.
Carol Bartz was dismissed as chief executive in September after failing to turn around the company's fortunes. Chairman Roy Bostock and co-founder Jerry Yang also later resigned from its board.
In January, former Paypal executive Scott Thompson was named the organisation's fourth chief executive in five years.
A recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft.
A statement issued by Mr Thompson's said: ""We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities. Our goal is to get back to our core purpose -putting our users and advertisers first - and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal.""
It added that the firm would now focus on a ""deep"" personalised experience for users and a return on investment for investors.
The firm has not given any indication of when the cuts would be made. It said it would provide more information about its ""future direction"" when it released an earnings update on 17 April.
As Yahoo shrinks, Skype is growing. Once all the new positions are filled, the business expects to have 1,600 employees worldwide.
As part of the expansion it is launching a new technology centre in central London. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts.
The UK government's desire to monitor people using its services did not influence Skype's decision
It aims to have completed the first stage of the hiring process by the end of June.
Skype's vice-president of product and design told the BBC the new jobs would cover software engineering, product management and design.
""We have one project about 'big data', which is about making use of data that our users generate when using the product to improve the quality of the products we offer,"" said Rick Osterloh.
""We also a number of initiatives we are working on in the web area, and we are hiring some positions for our newly formed Xbox division.""
Skype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored.
A statement from Skype said that: ""We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. We do of course comply with legislation in all countries in which we operate.""
Skype's use of peer-to-peer technology for its call and instant-messaging services means that it does not store the contents of communications on its servers, and so could not hand the information over unless it changed its systems.","It marks the sixth time in four years that the web portal has announced sizeable job cuts.

37680058,"Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International.
The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year.
It was a ""highly significant judgement"", Privacy International said.
As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the ""who, where, when, how and with whom"" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people.
Such data is ""vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets"", according to GCHQ.
Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary.
""It is very significant,"" said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird.
He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
""It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,"" said Mr Smith.
""Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.""
An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year.
It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed
The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore ""unlawful"".
""The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,"" said the Home Office in a statement.
""We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.""
